        You may know us as the “Unification Church.”
        While our name has evolved from the Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity to Family Federation for World Peace and Unification,
        our mission has also grown. We focus on creating world peace through the family: the school of love.

        FAQ
    </h1>
    <p class="Movement-text">
        <strong>What are the core beliefs of the ‘Unification Church’?</strong>
        <br>
        God is constantly seeking in our lives to make a personal relationship with us,
        and we have a unique take on how to achieve that.
        We believe that family is the cornerstone of society and of personal spiritual development.
        We learn about God’s love through our family relationships.
    </p>

    <p class="Movement-text">
        <strong>Is the ‘Unification Church’ a cult?</strong>
        <br>
        FFWPU is a duly registered religious nonprofit organization. Our organizations strives to promote world peace
        and unity as one family under God.
        Dr. J. Gordon Melton, a leading American new religions scholar, categorizes the ‘Unification Church’ as a religious movement.
    </p>

    <p class="Movement-text">
        <strong>Why does the ‘Unification Church’ hold mass weddings?</strong>
        <br>
        While many couples go on to have individual wedding ceremonies, the mass wedding ceremonies of the ‘Unification Church’ are a unique experience for couples to receive the Holy Blessing upon their union.
        We see marriage as not just a ceremony to bring two individuals together, but as representatives of what world peace can look like through generational and cultural healing.
        By committing to a relationship with other couples,
        they are making a public promise to bring joy to God through loving each other.
